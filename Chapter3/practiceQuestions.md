# Practice Questions

1) Functions help you not repeat code; instead of writing the same few lines of code over and over again, you can just call a function. They also help break logic into understandable chunks and using descriptive names can help self-document your code.

2) The code in a function is only executed when the function is called.

3) The "def" statement creates a function.

4) A function is the definition and a function call is executing that definition.

5) There is only 1 global scope in a Python program, yet there are as many local scopes as there are function calls.

6) Any local variables and their values are forgotten/destroyed when a function call returns.

7) Functions always return a value (can just be the "None" value though) and yes, that return value can be a part of an expression.

8) The default return value of a function is "None".

9) Using the "global" statement with the variable name at the beginning of the function allows that function to change a global variable.

10) The data type of "None" is the "NoneType" and it is the only value of that data type.

11) It imports the code in a module named "areallyourpetsnamederic".

12) You would call it with, "spam.bacon()".

13) You can use the "try" and "except" statements.

14) Put the possibly offending code in the try clause and handle it's possible errors in an except clause.
