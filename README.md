# Intro. to Programming
*A course for Adult and Community Education.*

A collection of materials for my Spring 2020 class, "Intro. to Programming."

## Getting Started
To avoid needing to install anything on the computers in the lab, students will use https://repl.it/ as their online development environment; it provides a file explorer and editor (allowing us to write scripts, save them, and execute them at-will) and a REPL (Read, Eval, and Print Loop) that allows for interactive exploration of the language with immediate feedback.

## Learning Materials
The book, *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python* by Al Sweigart, can be read in its entirety for free online on its website (https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter0/). I'll be primarily trying to follow along with the book; working through examples and demonstrating the concepts. Additional examples and problems will be provided as needed, depending on the class's progress with the concepts.
